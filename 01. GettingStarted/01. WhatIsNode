What is Nodejs
    Nodejs is an open source and cross platform RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT for executing JavaScript code outside
    of the browser.
    We often use Node to build:
     - back-end services => APIs(Application Programming Interfaces)
       these are the services that power our client app
       e.g Web App running inside of a web browser
           Mobile App running on a mobile device
           These client apps are simply what the users see and interacts with. These are the surface, they need 
           to talk to some services sitting on the SERVER or in the CLOUD to:
           - store data 
           - send emails
           - push notifications
           - kick up workflows
           - so on
     - Node is ideally for building apps:
        - Highly-scalable
        - data-intensive
        - real-time backend services 
        that power our client apps
    
    There're others tools and frameworks for building backend services such as:
     - ASP.NET
     - Rails or Ruby on Rails
     - Django
     
    But Node:
     - Easy to get started
     - Can be used for protoyping and agile development
     - Can be used for building superfast and highly scalable servoices
       e.g used in production for large companies such as paypal, uber, netflix, walmart, so on
     - In Node apps we use JavaScript, so we can reuse our JS skills and transiction into a full-stack
       developer.
     - We use our JS in the frontend and backend, so our source code will be cleaner and more consistent
       the same naming conventions, same tools and same practices
     - It has the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries available to us. For pretty much features we 
       want to add in our apps, there're some free open-source libraries that we can use, we dont have to 
       build these building blocks for scratch and focus in the core of our app.
