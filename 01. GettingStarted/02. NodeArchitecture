Node Architecture 
    Â¿What's a runtime environment really?
     Before Node we used JS only to build apps that run inside of a browser. Every browser has a JS EGINE that
     takes our JS code and converts to Machine Code.
     - Microsoft Edge uses Chakra
     - Firefox uses SpiderMonkey
     - Chrome uses v8
     This is why one JS code can behave different in one browser to another. 

     A browser provides a runtime environment for JS code:
      - In browsers we have the window/document object: These objects allow us to work with the enviroment 
        in which our code is running.
     
     Up-to 2009 the only way to write JS code was inside of the browsers. 
     In 2009 Ryan Dahl created Node came with a brillian idea: Would be great execute JS code outside of the 
     browser:
      - Took Google v8 Engine which is the fastest JS Engine out and embeded inside a C++ program an called it 
        Node.exe
    
     So similar to a browser, Node is a runtime environment for JS code, it contains:
      - JS Engine that executes JS code
      - Also has certain objects that provide an environment for our JS code, these objects are different 
        from the enviroment objects we have in browsers.
        e.g We dont have in Node document object, but instead we have fs(fileSystem), http(for listen a request)
            things that we cant do inside of a browser
        So these additional modules/objects give us capabilities not available inside browsers. 
    
    Node is NOT a programming language, dont compare with C#, Ruby, so on.
    Node is NOT a framework, dont compare with ASP.NET, Rails, Django.
    Node is a RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT for executing JavaScript code.
