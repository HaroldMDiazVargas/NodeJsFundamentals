First Node App
   
   Steps:
    - We create a new folder with the name of the app => first-app
    - We create a new file 'app.js', in this file we can write regular javascript.
      e.g function sayHello(name){
        console.log('Hello ' + name);
      }
      sayHello('Harold');
    
    - In terminal we run:
        node app.js

        This app.js that we're gonna pass to Node => Node is gonna give it to v8 for execution.



    If we have a file with:
        console.log(window);
     and then run with node => we get an exeption (window is not define)
     - Because in Node we dont have the 'window' or 'document' objects, these are part of the runtime environmnet
       that we get with browsers.
       We have other objects to work with:
        - files 
        - operating system
        - network
        - so on.
