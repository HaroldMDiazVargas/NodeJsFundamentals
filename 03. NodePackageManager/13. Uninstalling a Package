Uninstalling a Package
    Sometimes we want to uninstall a package if we dont require it.

    Uninstallation:
     - We run => npm uninstall packageName
                 npm un packageName

    Changes:
     - node_modules/ folder => is not longer the folder of the packageName once is deleted!
     - package.json file => not contains the dependency in the corresponding propery 
                            wether be "devDependencies" or "dependencies"


-- Terminal 
npm un mongoose
