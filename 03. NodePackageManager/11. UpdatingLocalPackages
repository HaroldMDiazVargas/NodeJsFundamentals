Updating Local Packages
    As we build our app, there may be newer versions of the dependecies we've installed. 

    See what packages are outdated:
     - We run => npm outdated
                 - This show only if the dependecies directly depended upon by the current project
                   have updates of new versions!
                 - If there are not new versions, we may see nothing in the terminal

     - We run => npm outdated --all
                 - To see all the dependecies even those that are not directly upon by the current project
    
    Understanding the versions:
     - Current: The current version (what we have in package.json) in our Node app
     - Wanted: This version represent a released version that match the corresponding Semantic Versioning(Tilde, Caret)
               and fits to this as the possible version updated(Different Minor or Patch version)
     - Latest: This is the latest version released of the Package, can be different Major, Minor and Patch version


    Updating packages:
     - We run => npm update
                 But this only work for updating Minor and Patch releases. This is good because we dont want 
                 any break changes in our app!
    
    Updating to Latest Version:
     - We run => npm i -g npm-check-updates     => we install this package
     - Then we run => npm-check-updates or ncu
                      - We can see all the outdates packages and their new versions available
                      - But if there're not new versions available, we dont get anything in terminal
     - Then we run => npm-check-updates -u
                         With this we upgrade(update) to the latest versions ONLY in the package.json
                         is not installed yet!!
     - Finally => npm i


-- Terminal 
npm outdated 

-- Output:

-- Terminal

-- Terminal

> ncu                                   => short of npm-check-updates
> ncu -u                                => update the package.json
> npm i                                 => Install all of package.json
