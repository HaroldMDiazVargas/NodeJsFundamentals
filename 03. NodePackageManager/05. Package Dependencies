Package Dependencies

    Exercise. Install node package called 'mongoose', this is used to store our data in mongoDB.

    In node_modules/:
     - We see a lot of libraries installed we never install:
       - These are other Node Packages that mongoose is dependent upon. Before all these dependencies of a Node 
         Package were stored in the folder of the installed node package. But this creates a mess!
         Exeption:
         - If one of these packages uses a different versions of one of these depedencies, that version will 
           be stored locally in that package!
