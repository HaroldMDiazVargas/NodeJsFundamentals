DevDependencies
    All the dependencies we've installed are: 
     - Application Dependencies: Our app needs these dependencies in order to function propertly
                                 e.g mongoose, underscore.

    But we have other kind of dependencies:
     - Development Dependencies: Dependencies only used during development, they should not go on the production 
                                 environment where we deploy our app
         e.g tools for running unit test, tools for static analysis in our code, tools for bundle JavaScript code, ...

    Install JSHint:
     - Node Package which is a static analysis tool for JavaScript code and looks for potential problems or
       syntactical errors.
     - We run => npm i jshint --save-dev 
                 --save-dev is a flag to specify as development dependency
    
    In package.json:
     - We can see jshint is under a new property called "devDependencies", this tells Node that this is a 
       development dependency and it should not go in the production environment.
     - "devDependencies": {
            "jshint": "^2.13.5"
            }

    In node_modules/ folder:
     - We can see the folder of jshint



    All dependencies wether are Application Dependencies or Development Dependencies they are stored inside 
    of the node_modules/ folder. Only segregate in package.json


-- Terminal 
npm i jshint --save-dev
