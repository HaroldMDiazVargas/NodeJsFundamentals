NPM Packages and SCM
    The size of node_modules/ folder will grow significantly in a real world app (fewGB). 
    We dont want to include this folder when:
     - checking our source code => into a source control repository
     - send the app to someone else e.g friend by email, usb, so on

    Dependencies:
     - All our dependecies are stored in package.json file. With this file wee can easily restore the exact version
       of the dependecies of any machine.
    
    Simulate:
     - Remove node_modules/
     - In terminal => npm i
                      - Looks package.json
                      - Download all dependecies from npm registry
    
    Exclude folder from Git:
     - git init (if we dont have git repository)
     - In root of the app folder => .gitignore file
                                    - list all files e.g node_modules/



-- Terminal
npm i



-- .gitignore 
node_modules/
