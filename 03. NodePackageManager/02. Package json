Package.json
    At this point we have a folder e.g npm-demo/ that represent our Node app.
    Before add any Node Packages to our app:
    - We need to create a file called: package.json: This is a json file that includes some basic information about our app
      e.g name, version, authors, address git repo, depedencies,...
          all these are metadata of our app
    
    Creating package.json file:
    - We run: npm init, this to create this file step by step
      - We need to answer bunch of questions:
        - package name: (npm-demo), this if the default name takes the folder where we're creating this file
        - version: (1.0.0)
        - description:
        - entry point: (index.js)
        - test command:
        - git repository:
        - keywords:
        - author:
        - license: (ISC)
        - Finally we have all the key:value pairs that represent all the metadata about our project
        - Is this correct ? Ok
    
    - Faster way supplying a flag:
      - npm init --yes: this way we dont have to go to each question one by one
