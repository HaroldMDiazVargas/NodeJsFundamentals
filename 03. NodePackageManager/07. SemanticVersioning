Semantic Versioning
    In dependencies we can see their version and a curious character:
    ^6.4.4
    
    SemVer(Semantic Versioning):
     - In SemVer the version of a Node Package had three components:
       - 1st: Major version, used for adding new feature that potentially can break the existing API
       - 2nd: Minor version, used for adding new features that font break the existing API
       - 3rd: Patch version/release (used for bug fixes)
    
     - e.g In the current version of mongoose(6.4.4) developers find a bug, they fix a bug and release a new version:
           6.4.5  => Increase patch version

     - e.g Mongoose developers add new feature without break the API, increase the minor version:
           6.5.0  => In this version haven't found a bug yet

     - e.g If add new feature can break existing app that depend upon this version of mongoose
            7.0.0 
    

    Caret character(^):
     - Tells to NPM that we're interesting in any version of mongoose as long as:
        - the Major version is the same (6)
        So if there's a newe/minor of Patch version available, we will be interested in that package as well
    
        e.g If someone install using => npm i
           - npm checks if there's a new version of mongoose but keeping the same Major version:
             In other words ^6.4.4 is equivalent to 6.x

    Tilde Character(~):
     - Tells to NPM that we're interesenting in any version as lon as:
       - the Major version is the same (6)
       - the Minor version is the same (8)

       e.g If someone install using => npm i
           - npm checks if there's a new version of mongoose but keeping the same Major and Minor version:
             In other words ~6.4.4 is equivalent to 6.4.x


    Problems:
     - Maybe is possible that even with Tilde or Caret character, when installing a different Patch or 
       Minor version generates a problem with our app. So we can remove these characters and whoever want 
       to install this app => always will install the same version!
