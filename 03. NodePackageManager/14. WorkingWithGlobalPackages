Working With Global Packages
    We have installed dependencies particular only to one Node app, these packages are called Local Packages

    But on NPM registry:
     - There're  Node packages that are not specific to an app, these are often command line tools
       that we want to access from everywhere.
       These Node packages are not tied to a specific folder or specific project

        e.g - npm is one of the Node packages, is a command line tool we can run from any folder
            - ng (@angular/cli), we use it to create new angular project
            - ts (typescript)
            - ...
    
    Listing all the outdated Global Packages:
     - We run => npm -g outdated
                 - We can see all the global packages are outdated.
                 - If there're not global packages outadated, we wont see anything in the terminal

    

-- Terminal 
npm -g outdated
