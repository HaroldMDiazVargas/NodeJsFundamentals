Installing a Specific Version of a Package
    Sometimes we need to install a specific version(not the latest):

    In terminal:
     - Run => npm i packageName@version

     We can check using => npm list => to check if the version is installed correct in node_modules/ folder


--terminal
npm i mongoose@2.4.2
