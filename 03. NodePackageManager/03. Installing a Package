Installing a Package
    Add a third party library/NodePackage to our Node app

    Underscore:
     - Popular JavaScript library
     - Installation:
       - Head over npmjs.com
       - search for underscore 
       - we see the command line to run to install this library. Also we see some info:
         - publisher
         - latest version
         - address of github
         - homepage of this package
         - name of collaborators
         - basic stats: downloads

       - In terminal => npm i underscore or npm install underscore

    Package.json changes:
     - In package.json we will see:
       - "dependencies" : new propery added
       - "underscore": "^1.13.4"
     This means in package.json we will have all the dependencies of our project and their versions.

    npm install:
     - When we run this command:
       - NPM is going to download the latest version of the given package from npm registry
       - Then NPM is going to store this package inside a folder => node_modules/
         - node_modules/ contains:
           - folder for every package
             - each folder contains a bucnh of files:
               - LICENSE
               - README.md
               - package.json: Every package has its own package.json file just like our node app
                               We see info/metadata about the corresponding package
