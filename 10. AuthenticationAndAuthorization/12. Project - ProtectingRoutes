Project - Protecting Routes

    To apply the Middleware Functions:
     - We can add to index.js like app.use()
    But this Middleware Function defined of that way will be executed before EVERY Route Handler!
    We don't want to Protect all API endpoints:
     - Some API endpoints should be public e.g registerUser, loging, getListGenres, ...
    
    Applying Middleware Function Selectively:
     - We go to the particular Route Handler
     - The router.post/get/delete/put..() takes:
       - Route/path
       - Middleware(optionally): This Middleware Function passed here will be executed just before the next Middleware Function,
                                 which in this case in the RouteHanderFunction which is exactly a Middleware!
       - RouteHanderFunction
     - So just import the Middleware Function on top and pass as the second argument!
