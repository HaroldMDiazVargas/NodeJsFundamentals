Project - Loggin Out a User
    We don't need a separate Route for loggin out users. Because we're not storing the token anywhere on the server so we don't need a separate
    Route Handler to delete the token! The token is stored on the Client!

    Loggin out feature needs to be implemented on the Client, not on the server:
     - On the Client-app when user logs out we simply delete the token from the Client!
     - Storing the token on the server is a very bad practice, because these tokens are like keys that give Clients access to protected 
       API endpoints. If a hacker can get access to our database and see all the tokens for Authenticate user, they don't even need to 
       know the passwords, simply get token and send to server request to protected APIs
     - If maybe we store tokens in Server => Hash the tokens!
     - Whenever we are sending tokens from the Client to the Server, we must ensure use HTTPS => data encrypted between Client-Server
