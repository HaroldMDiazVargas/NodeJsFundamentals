Introduction

    Authentication:
     - Is the process of identifing if the user is who they claim they are:
     - That's when the user logging, so the user sends:
       - username
       - password
       to the server and the server authenticates us
    
    Authorization
     - Is determinating if the user has the right permission to perform the given operation
       e.g Only logged users can perform certain operations like modify data
     - A user that is not logges is an Anonymous User
     - A user can have various roles:
       - Admin Users
       - ...
       This is a 2nd Level of Authorization
    

    New Endpoints:
     - Register: POST /api/users. For each user we want to have:
                                  - name
                                  - email => unique property to true in our Schema!
                                  - password
     - Login: We're not:
              - Creating a new resource
              - Updating a new resource
              - Removing a new resource
              So to implement this we refer to this as => Request of Command in RESTful terms
              Because is an operation that doesn't have CRUD semantic
              In this case:
              POST /api/logins
