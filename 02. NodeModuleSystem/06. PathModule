Built-in modules very useful in Node:
 - Head over nodejs.org
   - Docs(leftside)
     - vX.X.X LTS
      - Table of Contents 
        - Almost all of this list is a built-in module
          - File System: To work with files
          - HTTP: create web servers that listen for HTTP Requests
          - OS:   work with the Operating System
          - Path: Gives us bunch of utility functions for working with paths
          - Process: Gives us information about the current process
          - Query Strings: Useful in building HTTP Services
          - Stream: Allow us to work with Streams of Data
          - Others modules...


Path Module
On Documentation we can see all the functions define in this module:
https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/path.html

To use this module:
    const path = require('path');

path is an object stored in a constant.

The argument we pass to the require function:
 - Node assumes that this a built-in module.
 - If isn't built-in module:
   - Then Node look for existing of relative path to a file in this app

Methods of path:
 - There're various useful methods, one we use is parse()


So if we want to work with paths is easier to use this module instead of working with pure strings!


-- app.js

const path = require('path');

var pathObj = path.parse(__filename);

console.log(pathObj);


-- we will see the path object and its properties:
{ root: '/',
  dir: '/Users/...',
  base: 'app.js',
  ext: '.js',
  name: 'app'
}
