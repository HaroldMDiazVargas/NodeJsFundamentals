OS Module
    Get information about the current Operating System.
    In Documentation, we will see the methods available:  https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/os.html
     - os.freemem(): returns the amount of free memory on this machine
     - os.totalmem(): total memory we can get information about the current user
     - os.uptime(): returns the system uptime in number of seconds
     - ...
    
    Load OS Module:
        const os = require('os');

    One feature in ES6 is Template String, we can use this in Node instead of concatenate strings using '+'.


    Notes:
        Different browsers implement different settings of the feautes of ES6 /ES2015: ECMAScript6. But the 
        v8 we have inside of node is pretty UP-to-Date and implements a lot of new features of JavaScript defined
        in ES6. 

        Before Node existence, we couldn't see this kind of infor about OS system, because JavaScript only runned inside 
        browsers, and we only worked with window or document objects. Now we can run JavaScript code outside of browser(on the server)
        




-- app.js

const os = require('os');

var totalMemory = os.totalmem();
var freeMemory = os.freemem();

console.log(`Total Memory: ${totalMemory} `);
console.log(`Free Memory: ${freeMemory} `);

-- output:
Total Memory: 391872819
Free Memory: 102109212
