Introduction MongoDB
    We don't save data in the memory because when server restarts; all the data we're going to lose.
    For this we need to save data in a database

    MongoDB => mongodb.com
     - Very popular DBMs 
     - Quite often used in apps with Node and Express
     - Is a document database or also called NoSQL database; different from traditional databases(SQL) like SQL server, MySQL.
       In MongoDB we dont have the concepts of:
       - tables, schemas, design, views, records, columns, ...
     - In MongoDB we simply store our JSON objects/collections in there
     - When querying our data; we get JSON objects out of MongoDB and we can simply return that objects back to the client
       so there isn't Transformation
    
    Installation:
     - In the web page click over Product => Community Edition => Comunity Server
     - Once download the .msi file; gives us a simple installer:
       - next
       - accept License Agreement; next
       - Complete Installation
       - Install MongoDB as a service
       - Then in mogodb.com look for installer MongoDB Compass
       - Also in mongodb.com look for installer MongoDB Shell: mongosh
         - Unzip the file and all the content in bin/ folder paste in the PATH of the database server
       - The PATH of our MongoDB server is C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin
         here we have:
         - mongod: means mongo diamond which is a service that runs in the background and is basically our 
                   MongoDB server
       - Copy the PATH and goes to:
         - Advance system settings
         - Click on Environment Variables
         - Select PATH of the list of System Variables and click on Edit
         - Click on New and paste the PATH => OK!

     - Finally creates a new folder:  ❯ mkdir C:\data\db

    Connect to MongoDB server:
     - run => mongod
     - Open MongoDB compass and connecte to port 27017(default config)
       here we can see that we have three database:
       - admin
       - config 
       - local
