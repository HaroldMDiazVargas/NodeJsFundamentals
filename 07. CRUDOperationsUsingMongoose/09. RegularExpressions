Regular Expressions
    We use these Expressions to have more control over our Filtering Strings!

    Using Regular Expressions
     - To pass a Regular Expression instead of pass an String we add:
        /pattern/
     
     - ^: Represents a String that starts with something e.g /^Harold/
          Doesn't matter what are after
     - $: Represents a String that ends with something e.g /Diaz$/
          Doesn't matter how it starts
     - i: This is append at the end to indicates that we want to make the Regular Expression INSENSITIVE 
          e.g /pattern/i
     - .*: This means we can have 0 or more characters depending where we put this pattern
            e.g /.*Harold.*/
