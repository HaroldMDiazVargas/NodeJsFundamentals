Connecting to MongoDB
    
    Mongoose Package:
     - We need to install this Node package in our project
     - This gives a simple API with a MongoDB dabata
    
    Connect to MongoDB:
     - First we need to load mongoose module using require() function; this returns an object
     - This object has a method:
       - connect(): Method used to connect with MongoDB
                    This method takes:
                    - ConnectionString: This is the reference the MongoDB server + database. We may have:
                                        -'mongodb://localhost/playground' => reference MogoDB we install in our machine
                                                                             and MongoDB automatics create this database first
                                                                             time we wrtie something!
                                        - we can have another ConnectionString for our production Environment.
                                          We can manage these various configuration settings for different Environments
                                          using 'config' package!
                    This method returns:
                    - a promise: So we can call the methods:
                                - then(): arrow function when the connect is fullfill
                                - catch(): we get an Error Object and we can display on console



-- index.js

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/playground')
 .then(() => console.log('Connected to MongoDB...'))
 .catch(err => console.error('Could not connect to MongoDB...', err));



-- terminal
‚ùØ node .\index.js
Connected to MongoDB...
