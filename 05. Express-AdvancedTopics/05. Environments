Environments
    In a more complex-enterprise apps we need to know what Environment our code is runing at:
     - Developer Environment
     - Production Environment
    Perhaps we want to enable or disable certain features based on the current Environment

 
    
    - Process Object
      - This is a global object in Node that gives us access to the current process; this object has a property
        called:
        - .env: this gives us the Environment Variables:
          - NODE_ENV: Standard Environment Variable that returns the Environment for this Node app; 
                      if is not SET it returns undefined. Alternatively we can set it from the outside
                      - Development
                      - Testing
                      - Staging
                      - Production
    
    - Getting Current Environment
      - Using the Process Object directly
      - Using the app(express) object; that has a method:
        - app.get(): We use to get various settings about this app; one of the setting is 'env'
                     This method internally uses the Environment Variable NODE_ENV to detect the current 
                     environment. However if the Environment Variable is not set; this will return 
                     by default => Development
    
    - Enable morgan only DevEnv
      - We just use IF clause to check the current environment in the app and according to this 
        enable morgan only in Development Environment


-- index.js

const morgan = require('morgan');
const helmet = require('helmet');
const Joi = require('joi');
const express = require('express');
const app = express(); 
const logger = require('./logger');

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.static('public'))
app.use(helmet());

if(app.get('env') === 'development'){
    app.use(morgan('tiny'));
    console.log('Morgan enable');
}

app.use(logger);


console.log(`NODE_ENV: ${process.env.NODE_ENV} `);
console.log(`app: ${app.get('env')}`);


-- terminal
❯ nodemon .\index.js
Morgan enable
NODE_ENV: undefined
app: development
Listening on port 3000...


-- terminal 
❯ $env:NODE_ENV="production"
❯ nodemon .\index.js
NODE_ENV: production
app: production
Listening on port 3000...
