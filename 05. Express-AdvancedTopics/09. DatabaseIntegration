Database Integration
    Options of Database Integration when we use Node and Express => express.js.com/guide/database-integration
     - We can see various Database drivers that are available for us to use:
       - Cassandra
       - Couchbase
       - MySQL
       - MongoDB
       - Oracle
       - PostgreSQL
       - SQL Server
       - SQLite
       - ElasticSearch

    For each of these options we can see some sample code:
     - Install the driver for working with the specific database
     - Load drive using require()
     - Simple API to connect to the database; an access various collections and so on!
    
    MongoDB:
     - in canse of 'mongodb' there's another package called:
       -'mongoose': Built on top of 'mongodb' package. So instead of using the 'mongodb' driver directly
                    we use mongoose:
                    - it gives us a simpler API
