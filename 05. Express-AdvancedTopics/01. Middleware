Middleware or Middleware Function
    Core concept in express. This is basically a function that takes:
     - request object
     - return a response to the client or either pass control to another Middleware function

    Examples:
     - Route Handler function: In express every Route Handler function we have is tecnhically a Middleware function
                               because it takes:
                               - request object 
                               - returns a response to the client 
                               So it terminates the request-response cycle
    
     - express.json(): When we call this method, it return a Middleware function. Job of this function is:
                        - read a request: If there's a JSON object in the body of the request it parses the body
                                          of the request into a JSON object and then will set:
                                          - req.body property
                       Analyzing in runtime:
                       - When we receive a request on the server:
                         - the request goes into the Request Processing Pipeline which has:
                           - one or more Middleware functions and each of these:
                             - either terminates the request-response cycling by returning a response object 
                             - or it will pass control to another Middleware function
    Current code:
     - In our current implementation the Request Processing Pipeline has two Middleware functions:
       - 1. Middleware function that parses the body of the request into a JSON object, which in this case
            doesn't terminate the request-response cycling; it passes the control to the 2nd Middleware function
       - 2. Our Route Handler, we have the request object with the body properties popullated; so we perform 
            some operations and then terminate the request-response cycling by returning a response to the client.
                         
    Express Middleware function
     - exoress includes a few built-in Middleware functions
    
    Create custom Middleware functions
     - We can create these, and we can put at the front of our Request Processing Pipeline. So every request 
       that we send to the server will go throught our custom Middleware function, and we can:
       - perform cross-coding concerns: For example, do:
                                        - loggin
                                        - authentication
                                        - authorization
                                        - ...
    
    In other words
        Express App is nothing but a bunch of Middleware functions
