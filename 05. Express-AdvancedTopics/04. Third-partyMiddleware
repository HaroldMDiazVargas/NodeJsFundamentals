Third-party Middleware 
    Couple of third-party Middleware we have in express => express.js.com-Resources-Middleware
    Every Middleware function will impact the performance of our app, so it doesn't mean that we have to 
    implemente every third-party Middleware.

    - helmet
     - This is a Middleware that is considered best practice
     - This helps securre our apps by setting various HTTP headers

    - morgan
     - This another usefult Middleware function to log HTTP Requests by default in the console; but it can be 
       configurated to write in a file
     - when we call morgan() we need to specify:
       - various formats e.g 'tiny' => see documentation
    


-- index.js
const morgan = require('morgan');
const helmet = require('helmet');
const Joi = require('joi');
const express = require('express');
const app = express(); 
const logger = require('./logger');

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.static('public'))
app.use(helmet());
app.use(morgan('tiny'));

app.use(logger);
