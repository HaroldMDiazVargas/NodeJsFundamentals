Project - A better implementation
    - We move the ObjectId validation to index.js because we may want to reuse it
        Joi.objectId = require('joi-objectid')(Joi);
    - We use .objectId() in the validation method for movies request body
    - We change the 'let' to 'const' when we define the Document for:
      - customer
      - genre
      - mvoie
      because we know that we don't have to reset the Document to res.send to the client 
      when it .save() because the Document has already all Default and _id properties 
      given by mongoose that talks to MongoDB Driver!
      So we don't need to reset it; we just await for .save()
