Nodemon(Node Monitor)
    Everytime we make a change to the index.js code where we're making our Web Server:
     - We need to stop the process in therminal and start again

    Installation:
     - In terminal => npm i -g nodemon

    Using nodemon:
     - We run our app using nodemon => nodemon index.js
     - So nodemon is watching all the files in the folder:
       - *.* => any files with any extensions

    Proob:
     - Change index.js => Save!
     - Look the terminal => restarint due to changes!

    

-- Terminal
> npm i -g nodemon
> nodemon .\index.js
