Introducing Express
    Using HTTP Module and using:
     - const server = http.createServer((req, res) => { DefineRoutes and responds })
     As we define more routes:
      - We need to add more 'IF' clauses to the function
      - Is not very maintainable app

    Express
        The most popular Framework for building web apps and web services on top of Node that gives us a proper 
        structure to easily add more routes while keeping our app code maintainable

        - Head over npmjs.com/package/express
          - Statitics => A lot of downloads(very popular)
        
        Pros:
